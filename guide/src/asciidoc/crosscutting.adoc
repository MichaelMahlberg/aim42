[[Crosscutting]]
== Cross-Cutting Practices and Patterns

. Start with collecting problems.
. Evaluate those, determine priorities and _values_. This ensures you later solve _important_ and _relevant_ problems.
. Aligned with your problems, keep a list of potential improvements.

[[collect-problems]]
=== Collect Problems
You should constantly watch out for problems, issues and risks.
Keep a list of those problems. Regularly match those to your <<collect-opportunities-for-improvement, collection of possible remedies>>.

It's difficult to decide how much formalism to apply in collecting problems: Sometimes a wiki-page might suffice, for other systems a full-blown issue-tracker can be useful. 

As always: documentation is only valuable if it can be found and searched - which makes electronic approaches more viable.

[[collect-opportunities-for-improvement]]
=== Collect Opportunities for Improvement
You should look for improvement opportunities, remedies, measures, tactics and strategies in all of the aim42-phases.

[[improvement-backlog]]
=== Improvement Backlog
Keep a public, written backlog of possible improvements, remedies, tactics or strategies.

* Revise this backlog in regular intervalls.
* Define the _owner role_ for this backlog, similar to the _product owner_ in Scrum.
* Enhance the backlog with information from the <<evaluation>> phase, like cost, effort or risk.

=== Explicit Assumption
TODO

Also known as _educated guess_.

[[fail-fast]]
=== Fail Fast
The later a lack of quality is identified the higher are the costs to fix it. Continuously evaluate the quality of work artifacts and immediately take countermeasures or pull the plug as early as possible.

Suitable methods to identify such situations are:

* Code reviews
* Architecture reviews
* Peer reviews
* Testing in early stages
