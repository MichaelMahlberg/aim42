=== Goals

. Obtain overview of intent, purpose and quality requirements of the system.

. Develop and document an understanding of internal structures, concepts and architectural approaches.

. Find all problems, issues, symptoms, risks or technical debt within the system, its operation, maintenance or otherwise related processes.

. Understand root causes of the problems found, potential interdependencies between issues


=== How it works

Systematically look for such issues at various places and with various people.

INFO: To effectively find issues, you need an appropriate amount of _understanding_ of the systems, its technical concepts, code-structure, inner workings, major external interfaces and its development process.


. Start <<capture-quality-requirements, capturing current quality requirements>> from the _authoritative_ stakeholders of the systems.
. Conduct a <<Qualitative-Analysis,qualitative analysis>> of the system, its architecture and surrounding organization, based upon the specific quality requirements 
. Perform <<Static-Code-Analysis, static code analysis>>
. Conduct <<Stakeholder-Interviews, stakeholder interviews>>
. Perform a number of *runtime analysis*, e.g. performance and load monitoring, process and thread analysis
. Inspect the data created, modified and queried by the system, for structure, size, volume or specialities
. Inspect and analyze all involved organizational processes
(development, project-management, operations, requirements-analysis)   


WARNING: Never start solving problems until you have a thourough understanding of current stakeholder requirements. Otherwise you risk wasting effort in areas that no influential stakeholder cares about.
