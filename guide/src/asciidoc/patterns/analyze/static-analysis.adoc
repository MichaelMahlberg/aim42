=== Static Code Analysis 

==== Intent
Static Analysis can serve two purposes:

* Analyse source code to identify building blocks and their dependencies, determine complexity, coupling, cohesion and other structural properties. 

* Detect certain types of bugs, dangerous coding patterns and bad coding style.

==== Description
Use source code analysis tools to analyse static properties of the systems' source code,
e.g. the following:

Coupling and dependencies:: Where do the building-blocks (e.g. classes, packages, modules, subsystems) of your system depend upon? What are the intra-system call- and communication relationships?



==== Experiences
* Many projects (commercial and open-source) apply automated static code analysis as part of their build processes. 

==== Applicability
Apply static code analysis when the code base is medium sized or large and the appropriate tools are available.

* Many metrics and tools are tailored to OO languages.
* Dynamically typed languages often have limited tool support.
